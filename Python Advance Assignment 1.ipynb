    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "Sol: OOPs in Python is a programming approach that focuses on using objects and classes as same as other general programming languages. The objects can be any real-world entities. Python allows developers to develop applications using the OOPs approach with the major focus on code reusability. It is very easy to create classes and objects in Python."

    "Sol: An instance, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. In languages that create objects from classes, an object is an instantiation of a class. That's is, it is a member of a given class that has specified values rather than variables.\n"
