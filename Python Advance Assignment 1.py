# Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?
# Sol: OOPs in Python is a programming approach that focuses on using objects and classes as same as other general programming languages. The objects can be any real-world entities. Python allows developers to develop applications using the OOPs approach with the major focus on code reusability. It is very easy to create classes and objects in Python.
Q.2 Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?
Sol: inheritance search is simply a search of the tree from bottom to top looking for the lowest occurrence of an attribute name.Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?

Sol: I will explain it in the simplest way possible: Say you have 5 apples in your basket. Each of those apples is an object of type Apple, which has some characteristics (i.e. big, round, grows on trees).

In programming terms, you can have a class called Apple, which has variables size:big, shape:round, habitat:grows on trees. To have 5 apples in your basket, you need to instantiate 5 apples. Apple apple1, Apple apple2, Apple apple3 etc....
# Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?
# Sol: First argument is the class itself which is passed implicitly. Always return a valid object from __new__() . Not mandatory, but its main use is to create and return an object.
# 
Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?
Sol: 
"__init__" is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?
Sol: An instance, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. In languages that create objects from classes, an object is an instantiation of a class. That's is, it is a member of a given class that has specified values rather than variables.
Q7. What is the process for creating a class?
Sol: Create a Class. To create a class, use the keyword class :...
Create Object. Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects: ... Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?
Sol: Python super() The super() builtin returns a proxy object (temporary object of the superclass) that allows us to access methods of the base class. In Python, super() has two major use cases: Allows us to avoid using the base class name explicitly. Working with Multiple Inheritance.
